## Origin of data
U.S. Census API via {tidycensus}, and an [external dataset](https://data.virginia.gov/dataset/places-zcta-data-gis-friendly-format-2024-release) from the CDC via the Virginia Open Data Portal.

## Dependencies
For this worskhop you need to download and install R, RStudio, and the multiple packages.

You need the most current version of R (v4.5) and the most current version of each package. It is less critical that RStudio is updated to the latest version, but at least 2024.02 would be useful. [Installing and updating instructions for R are here](https://uvastatlab.github.io/install_r/).

Quarto comes installed in newer versions of RStudio but if you would like to check out features this is the link to the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/).

## Project goals and description
This workshop will give you:
- A short introduction to Census products and geographies available for analysis
- Quick tutorial on how to use the {tidycensus} package
- A review of three thematic mapping packages to compare features.

There will be code-along exercises as well as dedicated time for questions and practice.

If you are following along outside of the workshop, download and install R, RStudio, and the packages. Open RStudio, and go to File > Open File > open the 2025-08-25_workshop_spatial_census_r_code_v2_CODE_ALONG.qmd script. You will be able to follow along once you set up your project/working directory.

If you just want to follow along and run all the code in the script, then open the "completed_code" folder > click open the .html file > select an application to open it (e.g., Firefox browser).
